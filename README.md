# CRCProject
# This project was for a Computer Network Data Communications course
# The code provided by the professor would send a hexidecimal string to a server and retrieve the same string from the server
# On the Server end there was a script that would accept a string and then either sends the string back or changes one bit of the string and then sends it back
# The objectives of this project were to
# -Create a Function that would determine the CRC of a hexidecimal string
# -Using the calculated CRC determine if the string received from the server had been corrupted
# -Successfully send and receive 100 packets to the server
# -Measure total attempts and time taken between the first attempt and the confirmation of a succesful attempt
# -Make a graph for both the average Drop Rate and average Latency Time
